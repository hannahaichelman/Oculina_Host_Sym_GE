# Gene Expression Plasticity README

This folder contains the plasticity functions (PlasticityCustomFunctions_means.R) needed to complete the gene expression plasticity analyses included in the 03_DESeq_Scripts R markdown files. Also, it includes some other attempts at conducting DAPC and reaction norms of plasticity that aren't presented in the paper.
