# Gene Ontology Analyses README

This folder contains script needed to complete Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment Analyses ('GO_MWU.R'). All input files needed for the GO_MWU.R script are in the 'GO_MWU_input_files' folder. The output from the GO_MWU.R script were used to inform the heat maps that were produced in Figure 3D and Figure 6. The script needed to produce these heatmaps is 'GO_Term_Heatmaps.R'.
