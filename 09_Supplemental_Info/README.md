# Supplemental Information README

This folder contains four analyses that are included in the supplemental materials accompanying the main manuscript, which are detailed below.

'Culture_Growth':
This folder contains the data files (both .csv files) and script ('PlotCountData.R') needed to produce Figure S3, the supplemental figure that summarizes the cell density of the Breviolum psygmophilum cultures during the ex hospite experiment.

'SequencingStatsFiles':
This folder contains the ArrayQualityMetrics output that was considered when looking for outliers in the differential expression analyses.

'SNPCalling':
This folder contains the R script ('Cluster_Dendrogram_plot.R') and all input files needed to plot the cluster dendrograms presented in Figure S1 that was used to determine the Oculina arbuscula clones present in the dataset.

'Symbiont_Identity':
This folder contains information used to confirm the identity of the algal symbionts in this study. This includes the cultures (Sanger_Sequencing' folder) identified with Sanger Sequencing and the symbionts in symbiosis with Oculina arbuscula ('ITS2_Analyses' folder) identified with ITS2 metabarcoding and SymPortal.
